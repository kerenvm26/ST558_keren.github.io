_**EDA Strategy**_ _by Keren Vivas_

The cornerstone of my EDA strategy is to define my research question or questions. I need to identify the specific questions I aim to answer through the data exploration. This way, I maintain a clear focus during the exploration process and avoid wandering aimlessly. Naturally, I also remain open to discovering any interesting insights that might add value to my research or any side projects.

_**What is my overall goal when conducting EDA?**_

When I undertake EDA, my ultimate goal is to find answers to the research questions I've put forth. To achieve this, I utilize EDA to gain a profound understanding of the dataset, comprehending its characteristics and underlying patterns. This understanding allows me to extract insights, recognize trends, and validate hypotheses.

_**What methods do I consider important?**_

Several crucial methods include checking for missing data, summarizing data, describing data, understanding data distribution, detecting outliers, data visualization, relationship, correlation, and hypothesis formulation. In the section below, a little description/comment of each of these methods is provided.

1. Data Checking: This involves scrutinizing missing values, comprehending the reasons behind their absence, and determining the best way to handle them.
2. Data Summary: I aim to grasp the dataset's structure, such as the number of samples (rows), features (columns), and the context and purpose of the analysis.
3. Data Description: It's vital to identify the type of data involved, whether continuous, discrete, or categorical. This guides my choices for data visualization.
4. Data Distribution: I delve into vital characteristics of each feature, including its range and distribution, alongside basic statistics like mean, median, quartiles, and variance. I pay attention to any skewness or trends in the data.
5. Outlier Detection: Identifying outliers, data points significantly deviating from the rest, is crucial. They provide valuable insights or indicate potential data quality issues.
6. Data Visualization: Essential tools include histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heat maps. These visualizations help me understand data distribution, relationships between variables, and any unusual patterns or trends.
7. Relationship and Correlation: I explore relationships between features by plotting or calculating correlation coefficients.
8. Hypothesis Formulation: I create initial hypotheses and test them to validate the insights I gather.

_**What do I search for?**_

- I initially evaluate the data's quality, looking for completeness, identifying missing data, and determining if I can handle them without compromising the quality of my insights.
- I distinguish between qualitative and quantitative variables, which guides the types of summaries I can generate.
- I analyze the data distribution and look for outliers to decide on appropriate statistical methods.
- I begin by constructing a narrative to guide my data analysis, ensuring that the insights align with my research questions. However, I also remain open to unexpected discoveries.
- I select the right statistical techniques and tools to support further analysis.
