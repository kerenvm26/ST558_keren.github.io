**EDA Strategy** _by Keren Vivas_

The key point in my EDA strategy is to define what is/are my research question (s). What I am looking to find a question for based on the exploration of the data. So, it will have my target in mind and do hte exploration with a focus without going around blind. Of course, I keep my eye open for any interesting insigfths that can provide value for any sidce-project.

**_What is my overall goal when doing an EDA?_** 

My overall goal when doing a EDA is to find answer to my proposed research question. To achieve, I use EDA to gain a deep understanding of the dataset, its characteristics, and underlying patterns that will allow me to extract and uncover insigths, identify tendences and corrobote hypothesis. 

**_What methods do you think are important?_**

I think one of the most important methods are missing data checking, data summary, data description, data distribution,   

**Data checking:** Examine missing values, understand reasons behind, and how handle them.
**Data summary:** Understand the dataset structurenumber number of samples (rows) and features (columns), context and purpose of the analysis.
**Data description:** Identify the type of data involved, as continuous, discrete, or categorical to guide visualization choices.
**Data distribution:** Describe important characteristics of each feature, such as range, distribution, and variance. Note any skewness or trends in the data.
**Data visualization:** 
**Relationship and Correlation:** Explore relationships between features by plotting or calculating correlation coefficients.  
**Hypothesis formulation:** Create initial hypothesis and test them to enforce collected insigths.

**_What things do you try to look for?_**
1. I try to look first the quality of the data. It means of how complete it is, identify missing data and figure out if I can handle it without compromising the quality if the insigths collected.
2. I like to identify the variables that I have, qualitative or quantitative becuase it will drive the summaries that I can do.
3. I look how data is distributed, if it is present outliers. It will help me to further identify the appropriate statisitcal method.
4. I build the story and guide my data analytics to generate insigths that fit my story and provide useful insigths to my research questions.



a. Data Visualization:
o	Utilize graphical techniques to visualize data. Some of the essential tools include histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heat maps.
o	These visualizations help in understanding the distribution of data, relationships between variables, and any unusual patterns or trends.
b. Summary Statistics:
o	Calculate and analyze basic statistics such as mean, median, quartiles, and variance.
o	Use summary statistics to identify central tendencies and variability within the dataset.
c. Outlier Detection:
o	Look for outliers, which are data points significantly different from the rest of the data.
o	Outliers can provide valuable insights or indicate data quality issues.
d. Correlation Analysis:
o	Assess relationships between variables using correlation coefficients.
o	Identify strong positive or negative correlations, which can guide further analysis or modeling.
e. Distribution Analysis:
o	Explore the shape and characteristics of data distributions.
o	Detect skewness, kurtosis, and multimodality, which can impact model selection.
2.	Things to Look For:
o	Unexpected Discoveries: EDA is meant to unveil hidden insights that may not be apparent through formal modeling.
o	Hypotheses Generation: Use EDA to generate hypotheses about data relationships and potential causality.
o	Assumption Validation: Assess whether the data meets the assumptions required for formal statistical modeling.
o	Select Appropriate Tools: EDA helps in choosing the right statistical techniques and tools for further analysis.
o	Guide Data Collection: EDA can suggest additional data collection or experiments to explore interesting findings further.
In summary, EDA is a critical step in data analysis that focuses on understanding data through visualization, summary statistics, and pattern recognition. The main objective is to uncover hidden insights, generate hypotheses, and ensure that the data is well-prepared for more advanced statistical analyses or modeling. EDA is a flexible and exploratory approach, and its outcomes can guide further research and experimentation.


When conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the primary goal is to gain a deep understanding of a dataset by employing various techniques, particularly graphical ones. The focus is on exploring data without making strong assumptions about underlying models. Here's a breakdown of the strategy used in EDA, the overall goal, important methods, and what to look for:
Strategy for EDA:
1.	Maximize Insight: The EDA process aims to maximize insight into the dataset, allowing it to reveal its underlying structure and patterns.
2.	Uncover Structure: EDA seeks to uncover hidden structures within the data, including relationships between variables and key patterns.
3.	Extract Important Variables: Identifying the most significant variables or features is crucial in EDA. It helps in focusing on what's relevant.
4.	Detect Outliers and Anomalies: EDA includes the detection of outliers or anomalies in the data, which might require special attention or cleaning.
5.	Test Assumptions: Instead of making strong assumptions about the data, EDA tests underlying assumptions and allows the data to define the model.
6.	Develop Parsimonious Models: EDA encourages the development of simple and interpretable models that capture the essence of the data.
7.	Determine Optimal Factor Settings: EDA can assist in understanding optimal settings or conditions for factors or variables within the dataset.
Overall Goal of EDA: The primary goal of EDA is to provide a holistic understanding of the dataset by examining its characteristics and structure. Rather than forcing data into predefined models, the goal is to let the data speak for itself. EDA aims to generate insights, inform further analysis, and drive decision-making.
Important EDA Methods: EDA heavily relies on graphical techniques, as they are powerful tools for data exploration. Some important EDA methods include:
•	Plotting Raw Data: This involves visualizing data traces, histograms, bihistograms, probability plots, lag plots, block plots, and Youden plots.
•	Plotting Simple Statistics: EDA often involves plotting basic statistics like mean plots, standard deviation plots, box plots, and main effects plots. These visuals help in understanding data distribution and variability.
•	Positioning Plots: To maximize the ability to recognize patterns, EDA involves strategic placement of plots, often using multiple plots per page to facilitate comparisons and insights.
What to Look For: During EDA, you should be attentive to the following aspects:
•	Data Patterns: Identify patterns and trends in the data. Look for recurring behaviors or characteristics.
•	Outliers and Anomalies: Detect data points that deviate significantly from the norm, as they may indicate errors or interesting phenomena.
•	Variable Relationships: Investigate how variables relate to each other. Are there correlations, dependencies, or interactions?
•	Key Variables: Determine which variables are most influential and relevant for the analysis or problem at hand.
•	Data Quality: Assess data quality by identifying missing values, inconsistencies, or potential data quality issues.
•	Assumptions Testing: Verify or challenge any preconceived assumptions about the data and its distribution.
•	New Insights: Be open to discovering new insights or relationships in the data that were not initially anticipated.
Overall, EDA is a flexible and open-minded approach to data analysis that promotes a deep understanding of the dataset's structure and characteristics, with an emphasis on graphical techniques to reveal valuable insights.
