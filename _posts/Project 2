Hello!
Now, it is time to talk a little about my project 2.

**1. what I did do in the project and any interesting findings?**
I retrieved an API called makeup and explored interesting aspects such as the availability of types of makeup products and the prices and their distribution within US market, as well Canada and United Kingdom.
It is quite interesting how two companies are leading almost the whole US makeup market and how prices can incredibly change across brands.

**2. A reflection on the process I went through for this project. Are there things you learned programming-wise?**
Sure, I reinforced my abilities to understand writing functions as well as how to set up a rendered GitHub page site. Even though, I had problems when working in Github.

**3. What would you do differently in approaching a similar project in the future?**
I would leave more time for working in Gitbub before submission. Honestly, I am still dealing with this. I set up the rendering process many days ago and continued working on the project, which was going well but in the end, when I was on my time to submission, I faced several issues in Github.

**4. Link to the rendered GitHub pages site (the one that looks nice GitHub creates for you) and the regular repo (non-github pages site) as well!**
I am unsure about non-github pages. Please let me know what it should be. Just in case, I am adding the following ones:
https://kerenvm26.github.io/project_2/
https://github.com/kerenvm26/project_2
